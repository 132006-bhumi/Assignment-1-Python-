What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n","\n","Answer: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on four main principles: encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (reusing code from parent classes), polymorphism (using methods in different ways), and abstraction (hiding complex implementation details). OOP promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code."],"metadata":{"id":"4jL1LAgowkfk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. What is a class in OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have."],"metadata":{"id":"hfRsm78Ew5mn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3. What is an object in OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by the class."],"metadata":{"id":"69bIHbG4xFpf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n","\n","Answer: (a) Abstraction focuses on what an object does by hiding the complexity.\n","(b)  Encapsulation focuses on how an object's data is protected and accessed."],"metadata":{"id":"D82KELWGxPOV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods with double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They allow customization of basic behavior for objects, such as initialization, string representation, or operator overloading. These methods are automatically called by Python in specific situations.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iWSRzvlMxlMJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism where a new class (child class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class). It allows code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, enabling the child class to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class."],"metadata":{"id":"x5JAFpEYxwqK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of different classes to provide a method with the same name but different implementations. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on."],"metadata":{"id":"oZgQpYW7x8Mt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers to control the visibility of class attributes and methods. Attributes are typically made private (prefix with __) and can only be accessed or modified through public methods (getters and setters). This helps protect the object's state and ensures controlled access."],"metadata":{"id":"OGPUOkITyHCJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes with default or provided values."],"metadata":{"id":"eT_W5XX9yiUm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n","\n","Answer:(a)  Class method in Python is a method that is bound to the class rather than the instance. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself.\n","\n","(b) Static method is a method that does not take a reference to the class or instance. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace."],"metadata":{"id":"z2CF_GOeysYr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different arguments. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length argument lists (*args or **kwargs)."],"metadata":{"id":"lnxYjgr8y55y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","Answer: Method overriding in OOP occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The subclass method has the same name, signature, and parameters as the superclass method, allowing it to modify or extend the inherited behavior."],"metadata":{"id":"oJomlvhbzGkE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute. It provides a way to get, set, or delete an attribute while controlling its access through methods."],"metadata":{"id":"UfPXQKX70nV2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, enabling code flexibility, reusability, and the ability to call methods with the same name but different behaviors depending on the object."],"metadata":{"id":"t52X1aRi0xhZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used as a blueprint for other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods without implementation, and must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes are defined using the abc module."],"metadata":{"id":"R1Y-wU5c07Lk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n","\n","Answer: The advantages of OOP include:\n","\n","(a) Modularity: Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage.\n","\n","(b) Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance and polymorphism.\n","\n","(c) Maintainability: Changes can be made to one part of the system without affecting others.\n","\n","(d) Scalability: New features can be added easily through inheritance and polymorphism.\n","\n","(e) Abstraction: Complex systems can be simplified by hiding implementation details."],"metadata":{"id":"gnKdnytR1Gyg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n","\n","Anwser: (a) Class variable: A variable shared by all instances of a class.

It is defined within the __init__() method and accessed through an instance."],"metadata":{"id":"vDIPRXFD1dJx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q18.

Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: (a)  __str__: Defines the string representation of an object for human-readable output, typically used by print() or str().\n","\n","(b)__repr__: Defines the string representation of an object for debugging, aiming to be unambiguous and ideally evaluable using eval()."],"metadata":{"id":"8J9NAXi513e5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass, allowing access to the parent class's methods and properties.

What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: The __del__ method in Python is a special method called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.

What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: (a)  @staticmethod: Defines a method that doesn't access or modify the class or instance.

How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n","\n","Answer: Polymorphism works with inheritance by allowing a subclass to override methods of the parent class.

What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.
