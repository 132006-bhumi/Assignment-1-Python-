What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","Answer: A function is a reusable block of code not tied to an object or class by default.A method that is associated with a class or instance and operates on that context.used with object oriented operation.Methods can be thought of as specialized functions that are tied to an object."],"metadata":{"id":"t60q36YLhn3r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","\n","Answer: In python parameters are defined in the function defination that's work as a place holder for the values that the will use.Parameters are local to the function scope.In python arguments are actual values or data passed to the function when it is called."],"metadata":{"id":"OwkG2y1fuW-9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3.

It is a way for a function to produce an output that can be used elsewhere in your program.Functions that return values can be reused in multiple parts of your code, avoiding repetition and keeping the code clean."],"metadata":{"id":"M7VeSLPqugvA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5 what are iterators in python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","Answer: Iterables is any object in python that can return an iterator .Iterables are collections you can loop over.An iterator is essentially an object that keeps track of the current state of iteration and allows you to step through elements one at a time."],"metadata":{"id":"JhMnRqrGBI3V"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6 Explain concept of generator in python and how they are defined ?\n","\n","Answer: Generator is a function that yields value one by one using the yield keyword instead of returning all value using return Each time the generator’s next() method is called.Generators are a type of iterator, so they implement the iter() and next() methods, but unlike regular iterators, they are created using a function with yield."],"metadata":{"id":"8vtAl0VIBwWo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q7. what are the advantage of generator over regular fuction ?\n","\n","Answer: Generators produce values one at a time, only when needed. They don’t generate and store all values in memory at once, making them much more memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets.generators only yield one item at a time, they consume very little memory even for large or infinite sequences.Regular functions return all values at once.which requires storing all the values in memory. This can quickly become problematic when the dataset is large."],"metadata":{"id":"v32HbdhVCS5W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q8. what is lambda function in python and when typically used ?\n","\n","Answer: A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function that is defined using the lambda keyword. lambda function is a one-liner function that can have any number of input parameters but only one expression. The value of that expression is implicitly returned by the function.\n","\n","lambda arguments: expression where is lamda keyword is used to define the function ,arguments is input value , and expression is whose result is automatically return."],"metadata":{"id":"HlbdcgAPCdAO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q9. Explain the purpose and use of map function in python ?\n","\n","Answer: The map() function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return an iterator that produces the results. Essentially, it \"maps\" a function to every element of an iterable and yields the result of applying that function to each element."],"metadata":{"id":"iEe5_VNfCkmT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q10. what is difference between 'map()','reduce()'and 'filter()' functions in python?\n","\n","Answer: map() applies a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n","\n","reduce() applies a binary function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single result.reduce() import form functools library.\n","\n","filter() applies a function to each item of an iterable and returns a filtered iterator containing only the items for which the function returns True."],"metadata":{"id":"g0ZUh5ebCss5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Questions Assignment 3"],"metadata":{"id":"QOPg_i1MC4LZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q1.Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in\n","the list."],"metadata":{"id":"ArJhCjoSVT8V"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def sum_of_even_numbers(numbers):\n","\n","    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)\n","\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","result = sum_of_even_numbers(numbers)\n","print(\"Sum of even numbers:\", result)"],"metadata":{"id":"rGEkspT_Xj3N"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2.
