What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n","\n","Answer:- try Block: The try block contains code that might raise an exception. It allows you to test a block of code for errors during execution. If an exception occurs, the program control is transferred to the except block.\n","\n","except Block: The except block catches and handles the exception raised in the try block. It allows you to define how to handle specific errors and prevents the program from crashing."],"metadata":{"id":"mwXlEdRQxHGh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n","\n","Answer:- Python’s garbage collection system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming unused memory from objects that are no longer referenced. It uses two primary techniques:\n","\n","Reference Counting: Every object has a reference count that tracks how many references point to it. When the count drops to zero, the object is automatically deleted.\n","\n","Garbage Collector: Python’s garbage collector periodically checks for cyclic references (where objects reference each other but are no longer reachable from the program) and cleans them up, ensuring that memory is freed even in the case of circular references."],"metadata":{"id":"-wBVyi88xd4-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n","\n","Answer:- The else block in exception handling is used to define code that should run if no exception is raised in the try block. It allows you to separate the normal execution flow from error-handling logic, making the code more readable. The else block only executes when the try block completes without any exceptions."],"metadata":{"id":"3hm0kQVTyNZc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n","\n","Answer:- Python's logging module provides several logging levels, each representing the severity or importance of the logged message.
